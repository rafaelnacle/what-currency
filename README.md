This is a cool web scrapper that the user can check which currency is used in the country list from [IBAN](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes)

## Core features I learned
* Work with Beautiful Soup
* Use requests
* Web Scrapping
* How to use content from soup

It's pretty cool how fast you can build useful scripts with python.
