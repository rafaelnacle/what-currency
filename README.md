# What Currency

This is a cool web scrapper that the user can check which currency is used in the country list from [IBAN](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes) and select two countries to show the conversion value. 

The website used to get the conversions was [Wise](https://wise.com/gb/currency-converter/)

## Core features I learned
* Work with Beautiful Soup
* Use requests
* Web Scrapping
* How to use content from soup
* How to use headers to bypass with user-agent
* How to get data from 2 websites and merge into a single application
* Work with url params from a function and from a scraper

I still pretend to refactor this code and separate by modules.

It's pretty cool how fast you can build useful scripts with python.
